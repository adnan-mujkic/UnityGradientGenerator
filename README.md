A simple gradient generator for Unity.
<br />

This is a tool I developed out of necessity and also because I needed a way to quickly generate gradients without opening a image editing tool.
<br /><br />

Features:
* Supports horizontal, vertical, angled and radial gradients
* Export as .png wherever you want in the project 
* Add an image (transparent or not) and apply a gradient to it
<br />

Planned:
* Presets
