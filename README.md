A simple gradient generator for Unity.
<br />

This is a tool I developed out of necessity and also because I needed a way to quickly generate gradients without opening a image editing tool.
<br /><br />

Features:
* Supports horizontal, vertical and radial gradients
* Export as .png wherever you want in the project 
<br />

Planned:
* Add an image (transparent or not) and apply a gradient to it
* Option to compress horizontal gradients to 1px height and vertical gradients to 1px width so they use up less space
